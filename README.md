# github-api-concepts-nodejs
Simplified API that simulates in memory CRUD operations on Github Repositories

This API is the result of the first challenge proposed inside RocketSeat GoStack bootcamp.

Inside the docs folder there is a postman collection file that has all endpoint calls.

Import the file into Postman if you wanna try the API.
